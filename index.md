# Welcome, hacker

This intends to be a log of my own experiments with Guix. It started by a
suggestion by @civodul that I wrote down the notes produced during the
porting of Guix to PowerPC architecture (an effort that is not finished yet).
It is (and probably will always be) work-in-progress, but I think it might
be useful to anyone interested on the internal workings of Guix and GuixSD.

## About myself

I am @csanchezdll, software engineer, aviation enthusiast and flightsimmer.
If you are interested you can reach me by email (csanchezdll@gmail.com), better
using encryption (here is [my GPG key](pages/gpg.md)).
Also, most of my time I am on OFTC (csanchez) and freenode (csanchezdll).
